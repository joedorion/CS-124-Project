# CS-124-Project
This is my first Android project which was completed in CS124 at the University of Illinois.
For this project, I practiced using Java code to manipulate lists of restaurants and preferences stored as .csv files 
and serialized/deserialzed to appear in the display.
I got experience with having the app react to inputs from the user via clicking on a restaurant from the list and typing in the search bar.
